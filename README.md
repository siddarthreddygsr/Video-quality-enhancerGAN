# SR-GAN upscaling videos

This repository contains code to increase the resolution of a video using a GAN.

## USAGE

```bash
git clone git@github.com:siddarthreddygsr/Video-quality-enhancerGAN.git
cd Video-quality-enhancerGAN
```

I would suggest to use a docker container or a conda environment to install all the requirements.

replace the file path with the file you want to upscale here.
```py 
video1 = cv2.VideoCapture("data/test3.mp4")
```
